# microswitches_dihedral_angles
According to the common activation mechanism of A-class GPCRs; angular changes occurring in the micro-switch parts of GPCRs are important for receptor activation. Therefore, you can use this code to determine the angular changes of the dihedral angles (phi, psi and chi) of the micro-switch residues throughout the simulation using trajectory files.
